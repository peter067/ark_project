Not completed. 

Due to some time constraints; since I do have part time job during the weekends I could not finish all the requirements in time.
This is what I was able to accomplish if you do not think I am suited for the position that is okay.
I am just thankful for the chance you guys have offered me.

The project should have a "Test1.txt" file with the JSON data that is read and parsed to JSON data in the code.



Used Postman to test and debug while developing. 

By sending a full JSON data type to the "Post" will update/change the data if there is not matching key then it will automatically
add the new key and the data.(However it will NOT update the Test1.txt file).

Sending data to "Get" will run a dept search to see if there is a key match if there is will output the value. 
If not then error. 

All the result will be through console.log.

Like mentioned above this is not completed but this was what I was able to accomplish given my time. 
Once again thank you for the oppoutunity.
